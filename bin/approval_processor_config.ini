# In Reeds code, the FAR is automatically 1.5595366844e-05. So we will test with this value.
# All FAR thresholds for a specific pipeline and search must be of the form farthresh[pipeline.search]
# I believe Reed said that 0.05 is reasonable for the idq threshold for testing purposes... I set it a lot lower than that right now to get *some* events to pass.
