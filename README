Welcome to GRiNCH, the Gravitational-wave Candidate Event Helper.

More information can be found at the website:

To install GRINCH locally:
   python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/install/directory

NOTE: Aspects of the code currently assume the installdir is $HOME/opt, and
will break if this is not the case.

To run the GRINCH unit tests:
   python setup.py test
 (This functionality is to come.)

Finally, the most current GRINCH development version is always available from the
git repository:

git clone https://versions.ligo.org/git/grinch.git                       

However, this will require a valid cookie with versions.ligo.org:

   ecp-cookie-init LIGO.ORG https://versions.ligo.org/git albert.einstein
   git config --global http.cookiefile /tmp/ecpcookie.u`id -u`
