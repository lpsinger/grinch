To install GRINCH locally:
   python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/install/directory

NOTE: Aspects of the code currently assume the installdir is $HOME/opt, and
will break if this is not the case.

To run the GRINCH unit tests:
   python setup.py test
 (This functionality is to come.)

Finally, the most current GRINCH development version is always available from the
git repository:

   git clone albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/git/grinch.git
