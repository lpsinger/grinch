# The FAR is set to 1/day which is 1/86400 Hz. This is about 1.16e-05. So we will test with this value.
# All FAR thresholds for a specific pipeline and search must be of the form farthresh[pipeline.search]

# I believe Reed said that 0.05 is reasonable for the idq threshold for testing purposes.

# humanscimons is either 'yes' or 'no'. 'yes' means we wait for human signoffs. 'no' means we do not

# hardware_inj is either 'yes' or 'no'. 'yes' means treat hardware injection events as real events. 'no' means we do not. 
# For ER7 we want to treat hardware injections as real events, so it is set to 'yes'. for science runs it should say 'no'.
