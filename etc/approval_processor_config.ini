# hardware_inj is either 'yes' or 'no'. 'yes' means treat hardware injection events as real events. 'no' means we do not.

# ignore_idq is a list of groups that will not use iDQ information. it will determine whether use_idq is either 'yes' or 'no' in approval_processor.
# use_idq = 'yes' means we use iDQ information to perform data quality checks. 'no' means we do not.
# The default_idqthresh is set to 0.05.
# All iDQ thresholds for a specific pipeline and search must be added in the form idqthresh[pipeline.search]
