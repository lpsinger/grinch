Installing GRiNCH
-----------------

To install from the git repository hosted on LIGO-VCS, use the albert.einstein
credentials via:

    git clone albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/git/grinch.git
    cd grinch
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/opt

Note: Aspects of the code currently assume the installdir is $HOME/opt, and
will break if this is not the case.
